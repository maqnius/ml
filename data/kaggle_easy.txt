Here are a few links to some 'easy' classification datasets from kaggle.com.
Those are good to get started.

In general, for any kaggle dataset, there is a
'data' tab where a 'train.csv' and a 'test.csv' dataset can be downloaded. the
'train.csv' dataset contains labelled data and should be used to train the model.
The 'test.csv' dataset should be used for testing. If you want to see how well you
do, you can create an account for your team and submit your predictions for
'test.csv' to the website. You will then appear on the 'Leaderboard' tab.

Feel free to explore https://www.kaggle.com/competitions for more datasets. I do
recommend starting with the ones below though. Inform me if you want to use other
datasets.

The datasets below do not have a 'test.csv' - all the data is labelled. You should
split the data into 'train' and 'test' yourself if you want to work with this.

4) Iris species (another famous small dataset):
